# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

## 🎯 Overview
A comprehensive machine learning project that predicts passenger survival on the Titanic with **83% accuracy** using advanced feature engineering and ensemble methods.

## 📊 Results & Impact
- **Model Accuracy:** 83% on test set
- **Key Insight:** Title (Mr./Mrs./Miss) was the strongest predictor of survival
- **Business Value:** Demonstrates how feature engineering can uncover hidden patterns

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-survival-prediction.git

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the analysis
jupyter notebook titanic_analysis.ipynb
```
📈 Key Features
Advanced Feature Engineering: Created Title, FamilySize, and IsAlone features

Model Optimization: Used GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning

Comprehensive Evaluation: Confusion matrix, classification report, and feature importance analysis

💡 Lessons Learned
Feature engineering can be more impactful than model selection

Domain knowledge significantly improved feature creation

Simple models with great features often outperform complex models
